## learning erlang 

Erlang has a steep learning curve in my opinion, it also does a bad job selling itself. I'm also interested in learning Erlang *NOT* elixir (which i'm less of a fan of due to its yucky ruby syntax). That's right I prefer Erlang syntax over Elixir.

## aims

The aim of this repo is to help break through the barriers you will encounter learning erlang...

* inconsistent and legacy stuff
* walled gardens and hard to find knowledge
* lack of tutorials
* lack of code examples
* lack of cookbooks

## why learn Erlang?

I went round the houses with distributed systems and tried to apply the ideas from Erlang to node js microservices. All other sequential languages have shoe-horned the concurrent aspects. Distributed systems are hard (believe me), and I think its worth learning Erlang which was designed for concurrent and parallel programming using the actor model. The diffulcties in wrapping your head around Erlang are worth it later on.

It may be 'easier' to use a hodge podge of node, haskell or whatever else... but you will pay in cognative dissonance and un-tamed complexity. When dealing with distributed systems, un-tamed complexity and inconsistency is not what you want... If you learn Erlang/OTP you will not get nasty surprises using other peoples code and vice-versa. To compare this with other languages that provide concurrency and distribution via libraries and add-ons you will encounter subjectivity and no two projects will look the same or have the same conventions.

I also believe Erlang to the future of programming due to its inherent concurrency and use of the Actor model, Erlang could sell its self as the *ONLY* languages built for concurrency from day one. I also find its pragmatic use of functional programming with side effects to be refreshing and fun compared to haskell (and the dreaded monad). There really is nothing quite like Erlang!
